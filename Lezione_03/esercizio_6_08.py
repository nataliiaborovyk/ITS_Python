'''
6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents 
a different pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and 
the ownerâ€™s name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, 
loop through your list and as you do, print everything you know about each pet.
