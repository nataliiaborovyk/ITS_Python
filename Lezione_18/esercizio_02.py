Password Validation:  Write a function validate_password(password) that checks whether a password meets the following criteria: Minimum length of 20 characters, 
At least three uppercase letters, At least four special characters (non-alphanumeric). If the password is valid, the function should return True. 
If the password is invalid, the function should raise a built-in exception (e.g., ValueError) with a message indicating which criteria were not met.
